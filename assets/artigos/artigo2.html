      <p>A complete guide to take your first steps into the world of investing...</p>

      <p>Starting to invest may seem scary, but it's simpler than you think. With the right information and some discipline, anyone can make their money work — even with small amounts. This guide will show you exactly how to start.</p>

      <h2>Why start investing early?</h2>
      <p>Investing young brings advantages you can't get back later:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compound interest:</strong> Your money earns on top of earnings</li>
        <li><strong>Time to recover losses:</strong> You can take more risks</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy financial habits:</strong> You learn long-term thinking</li>
        <li><strong>Early independence:</strong> You can retire earlier</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <div class="tip-title">Important Fact</div>
        <p>If you invest R$200/month starting at age 20 (at 0.7% monthly return), by age 60 you’ll have about R$600,000. If you start at 30, you’ll have around R$250,000. Time is your greatest ally!</p>
      </div>

      <h2>First steps before investing</h2>

      <h3>1. Organize your personal finances</h3>
      <p>Before investing, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track expenses and know where your money goes</li>
        <li>Have an emergency fund (3–6 months of costs)</li>
        <li>Be free of high-interest debts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Define your goals</h3>
      <p>Investments should have a purpose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short-term (1–3 years):</strong> Travel, course, car down payment</li>
        <li><strong>Medium-term (3–10 years):</strong> Home, graduate school</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term (10+ years):</strong> Retirement, financial independence</li>
      </ul>
